## Oh, you finally found meüëã

_Coding like poetry should be short and concise_

As a Frontend Developer, I have a passion for creating web applications that live on the internet. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Tashkent University of Information Technologies, where I learned the fundamentals of programming, software engineering, and web development.

I have worked on local and foreign projects, designing and building user-friendly websites and applications with React.js and TypeScript. I have collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software solutions on time and within budget. Some of my recent projects include a CRM system for Asakabank and a education website for Fozilov Academy, which I also founded. I enjoy being part of these projects and using my skills to help make them a success.

My goal is to help businesses reach new heights by providing clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces that engage and attract users. I take pride in creating functional and visually appealing interfaces that prioritize performance and ease of use. Collaboration is crucial to me, and I enjoy working closely with teams to ensure a smooth development process that exceeds expectations. Let's work together to bring your ideas to life!
